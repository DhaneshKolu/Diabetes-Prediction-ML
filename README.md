# Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks (Binary Classification)

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical measurements such as Glucose, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.  
A fully connected neural network (MLP) was built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Key Concepts
- Binary Classification  
- Neural Networks (Dense Layers)  
- Data Scaling & Preprocessing  
- Stratified Train-Test Split  
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)  
- Overfitting Analysis (Training vs Validation curves)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## Files
- `Diabetes.ipynb` – Main notebook containing preprocessing, training, evaluation  
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies  
- `/assets` – (Optional) Images and plots  

## Model Architecture
- Dense(32) → ReLU  
- Dense(16) → ReLU  
- Dense(1) → Sigmoid  

Loss: **binary_crossentropy**  
Optimizer: **Adam**

## Results
- Accuracy: **~X%**  
- Visualized ROC curve  
- Training/Validation loss curves
